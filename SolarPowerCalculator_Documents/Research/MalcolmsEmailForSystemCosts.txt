Hi Glenn,

 

I have found two quotes.  They are not as detailed as I thought they were.

 

Quote 1

5 KW inverter

26 x 190W panels

Installation

Total - $17990

 

Quote 2

5 KW inverter

26 x 185W panels

Installation

Total - $16700

 

I think inverter cost would be roughly $6000 to 7000.

I think installation cost would be roughly $2000 to $2500

 

The inverter costs probably scale back based on size to some base cost.

Installation would probably be similar across all systems although there would be a component for time to install n panels which would reduce the overall installation cost.

 

I did find this website which has costs for a number of panels and inverters.
